## Notebook Guide

### 1. Environment Setup

Notebook: `01_environment_setup.ipynb`

This notebook walks you through setting up your environment, connecting to the LLM evaluation platform, and configuring the necessary libraries. It ensures that you are ready to evaluate models efficiently.

### 2. Basic Usage

Notebook: `02_basic_usage.ipynb`

This guide demonstrates how to perform basic evaluations on pre-trained models. Youâ€™ll learn to input data, apply standard metrics, and retrieve results to understand model performance.

### 3. Custom Metrics

Notebook: `03_custom_metrics.ipynb`

Learn to define and use custom evaluation metrics tailored to your use case. This notebook helps you set up metrics beyond the standard ones, such as BLEU, ROUGE, and accuracy.

### 4. Batch Evaluations

Notebook: `04_batch_evaluations.ipynb`

For larger datasets, batch processing is essential. This notebook shows how to handle large-scale evaluations by batching inputs, optimizing performance, and monitoring progress.

### 5. Advanced Analysis

Notebook: `05_advanced_analysis.ipynb`

Dive deeper into your evaluation results with advanced data analysis techniques. This notebook covers visualization, statistical analysis, and trend identification to enhance insights.
