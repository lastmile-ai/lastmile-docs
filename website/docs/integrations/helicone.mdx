# LastMile x Helicone

[Helicone](https://helicone.ai/) is a popular open-source AI observability platform that helps you monitor AI applications, track experiments and run evaluations.

LastMile has partnered with Helicone to provide AutoEval's [metrics](/autoeval/metrics) natively within the Helicone platform.

2. Go to **Evaluators** and *Create New Evaluator*
3. Select **LastMile AutoEval** tab, and select the desired [metric](/autoeval/metrics) as the *Evaluator Type*.

    Currently, only predefined evaluator metrics are supported. Fine-tuned metrics cannot be used at this time.

4. Select the columns of the data to evaluate. 

    For example, you can measure the Faithfulness of the output to the `context` provided with respect to the input:

5. (optional) You can test the metric right there with the **Test** option 

6. After the evaluator has been saved, you can open it and **Create Online Evaluator**.

    Configure the sampling rate and it will be run on sampled live traffic.
    For more information, check out the [Helicone Evaluation](https://docs.helicone.ai/features/advanced-usage/scores) docs.
