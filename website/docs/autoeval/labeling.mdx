# Synthetic Labeling

Generate high-quality labels using LLMs + human refinement

LLM Judge uses LLMâ€™s to evaluate the performance of your AI application. This is a good way to generate synthetic labeled datasets which can be distilled into a [fine-tuned evaluator model](/autoeval/fine-tune).

![AutoEval Flow](/img/autoeval_flow_labeling.png)

<u>Overall flow:</u>
* **Upload** data: Start by [uploading](/autoeval/datasets) a few examples of the application (e.g. input/output/context).
* **Specify eval criteria** (prompt): Define an evaluation criteria as a prompt, which is used by an LLM judge to label the app data.
* **Refine** with human-in-the-loop: A few examples are labeled by a human (active labeling) to iterate on the LLM judge labels.

### Why?

Most applications have few to no labels or ground truth data. For those use cases, AutoEval provides the ability to synthetically generate labels.

The platform asks for an evaluation criteria (a prompt), and labels AI interactions as positive (1) or negative (0) using an LLM (LLM Judge).
From there, a developer can manually refine some labels, which are fed back in to the labeling job as few-shot examples.

### Usage Guide

#### API

:::info
See the [API section](/sdk) for more info on the API, such as provisioning API keys, examples, etc.

<Tabs groupId="label_dataset">
  <TabItem value="python">
  
  ```python title="label_dataset"
from lastmile.lib.auto_eval import AutoEval, BuiltinMetrics

client = AutoEval(api_token="api_token_if_LASTMILE_API_TOKEN_not_set")

job_id = client.label_dataset(
    dataset_id=dataset_id,
    prompt_template=BuiltinMetrics.FAITHFULNESS, # Or a custom evaluation prompt criteria
    wait_for_completion=False
)
print("Waiting for job to complete...")
client.wait_for_label_dataset_job(job_id)

labeled_dataset = client.download_dataset(dataset_id)

print(f"Labeling Job with ID: {job_id} Completed")
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="node.js">
  
  ```typescript title="label_dataset"
import { AutoEval, BuiltinMetrics } from "lastmile/lib/auto_eval";

const client = new AutoEval({
  apiKey: "api_token_if_LASTMILE_API_TOKEN_not_set",
});

const jobId = await client.labelDataset({
    datasetId,
    promptTemplate: BuiltinMetrics.FAITHFULNESS, // Or a custom evaluation prompt criteria
    waitForCompletion: false, // Set to true to wait for the job to complete
});

console.log(`Waiting for labeling job ${jobId} to complete...`);
await client.waitForLabelDatasetJob(jobId);
console.log(`Labeling Job with ID: ${jobId} Completed`);
const labeledData = client.downloadDataset(datasetId);

console.table(labeledData);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### UI

1. Navigate to [Dataset Library](https://lastmileai.dev/datasets) and open a Dataset to label.
![View Dataset](/img/datasets/get_dataset.png)

2. Click **Generate LLM Judge Labels**.
3. Specify evaluation criteria in the form of a prompt, or use one of the predefined templates.
   :::tip
   You can reference column names inside the prompt using `{column_name}` syntax. For example, if your evaluation criteria needs to reference the output, add `{output}` to the prompt string
   :::
4. (optional) Provide few-shot examples to be used to refine the quality of the labels you are generating.
   :::tip
   We recommend having a diverse set of examples for your 5-20 examples for optimal performance.
   :::
5. Click **Start Labeling** and we'll generate 16 labels for you to review and edit
![Start Labeling](/img/labeling/labeling_criteria.png)
6. Review the labels to see if the labels accurately represent your evaluation criteria. 
If not, you can manually update the label, or **Change Configuration** to update the prompt.
![Review Labels](/img/labeling/labeling_review.png)
   :::tip
   If you don't want to review all 16 labels, click on the last page dot directly.
   :::
9. Click **Review and Submit**, which shows all 16 labels in one table, and gives you a final change to update them. 
These labels are used as further few-shot prompts to help improve the LLM Judge labeling quality.
10. Click **Submit** to start the full labeling job
