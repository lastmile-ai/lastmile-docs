# Evaluator Fine-tuning

Build your own evaluation metric by fine-tuning [alBERTa evaluator models](/autoeval/models)

![AutoEval Flow](/img/autoeval_flow_finetuning.png)

The AutoEval fine-tuning service enables you to develop models that represent your custom evaluation criteria. The flow is roughly as follows:
1. Start with a [Dataset](/autoeval/datasets) of your application data.
2. (Assuming you don't have labels) Specify your evaluation criteria and generate labels with [synthetic labeling](/autoeval/labeling).
3. Use the AutoEval fine-tuning service to train a fine-tuned evaluator model using the labeled data to learn the evaluation criteria.

The fine-tuned model will then produce a numeric 0->1 probability score for every request.

Some example evaluators that AutoEval customers have trained:
* A custom **response quality** metric that includes succinctness, clarity, and accuracy.
* A custom **correctness metric** for tool use (function calling) in a multi-agent system.
* A custom **brand tone** metric to measure LLM response adherence to company's brand tone rubric.

### Why fine-tune?

Fine-tuning your own alBERTa evaluator model is much more effective than LLM Judge style eval approaches for a number of reasons.
Unlike an LLM Judge, this model can be small, fast and include human-in-the-loop refinement:
* **better metric quality** -- the quality of evaluations is bound by quality of the labels (which can be refined with human feedback), not bound by an LLM's ability to understand your application context.
* **small & fast** -- 100x faster than LLM Judge (can run inference in 10-300ms), which allows these evaluators to run online as [guardrails](/autoeval/guardrails).
* **customizable** -- the model is simply learning the label distribution, making it easy to teach it any kind of classification task.

You can fine-tune as many evaluators as you want â€“ one for each evaluation criteria you need for your application.

## Usage Guide 

### Upload Datasets
[Create a Dataset](/autoeval/datasets#create-a-new-dataset) containing the application trace data to use for fine-tuning. 

:::tip
We recommend at least a few hundred examples (256 minimum). A few thousand examples is ideal.
:::

During the fine-tuning flow you can choose which of these columns to include in the training. Make sure that the data contains at least one of the following columns:
* `input`
* `output`
* `ground_truth`

:::tip
Don't have app data handy? No problem - check out our [Example Datasets](/autoeval/datasets/example-datasets) to get synthetic datasets to try out the platform.
:::

### Label data
Use [synthetic labeling](/autoeval/labeling#usage-guide) flow to define your evaluation criteria and generate labels.

### Training and test data split (optional)
Split the dataset into a training dataset and a test (holdout) dataset.

:::tip
We recommend an 80/20 or 90/10 split.
:::

You can do this via [API](/sdk):

<Tabs groupId="split_dataset">
  <TabItem value="python">
  
  ```python title="split_dataset"
from lastmile.lib.auto_eval import AutoEval, Metric
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import pandas as pd

client = AutoEval(api_token="api_token_if_LASTMILE_API_TOKEN_not_set")
dataset_df = client.download_dataset(dataset_id=dataset_id) # Labeled dataset from previous step

# Split the data into training and test sets
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

train_df.to_csv('train.csv', index=False)
test_df.to_csv('test.csv', index=False)

test_dataset_id = client.upload_dataset(
    file_path="test.csv",  # Your test dataset file
    name="My Test Dataset for Fine-tuning",
    description="Test dataset for evaluating the fine-tuned model"
)

train_dataset_id = client.upload_dataset(
    file_path="train.csv",
    name="My Training Dataset for Fine-tuning",
    description="Training dataset for the fine-tuned model"
)
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Fine-tune model
At this point we have labeled application data to train, and test the model. Time to fine-tune!

#### API
<Tabs groupId="fine_tune">
  <TabItem value="python">
  
  ```python title="fine_tune"
# Continuation from previous step
fine_tune_job_id = client.fine_tune_model(
    train_dataset_id=train_dataset_id,  
    test_dataset_id=test_dataset_id,
    model_name="My Custom Evaluation Metric",
    selected_columns=["input", "output", "ground_truth"], # You can decide which of these columns to include in the training data
    wait_for_completion=False # Set to true for blocking
)

print(f"Fine-tuning job initiated with ID: {fine_tune_job_id}. Waiting for completion...")
client.wait_for_fine_tune_job(fine_tune_job_id)
print(f"Fine-tuning job completed with ID: {fine_tune_job_id}")
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="node.js">
  
  ```typescript title="fine_tune"
import { AutoEval } from "lastmile/lib/auto_eval";
const client = new AutoEval({
    apiKey: "api_token_if_LASTMILE_API_TOKEN_not_set",
});
const modelName = "My Custom Evaluation Metric";
const fineTuningJobId = await client.fineTuneModel({
    trainDatasetId: datasetId,
    modelName,
    selectedColumns: ["input", "output", "ground_truth"],
    waitForCompletion: false, // Set to  true to block until completion
});

console.log(`Fine-tuning job initiated with ID: ${fineTuningJobId}. Waiting for completion...`);
await client.waitForFineTuneJob(fineTuningJobId);
console.log(`Fine-tuning job completed with ID: ${fineTuningJobId}`);
```

  </TabItem>

#### UI
1. Navigate to [Model Console](https://lastmileai.dev/models) and click **Fine-Tune a Model**.
![Model Console](/img/models/model_console.png)

2. Fill out the Fine-tuning form and click Submit to start the training job.
![Fine-tuning Wizard](/img/models/fine_tuning_form.png)

3. Track progress in the [Model Console](https://lastmileai.dev/models), including training metrics such as loss/accuracy.
    :::info
    [Set up](#weights--biases-integration) your Weights & Biases API key to have the training data logged to your own W&B account if you prefer.

### Use fine-tuned model

Once the model is trained and deployed on the inference server, it will be listed as ðŸŸ¢ **Online** in the dashboard.

![Fine-tuned Model Details](/img/models/fine_tuning_model_details.png)

You can try it out directly in the playground, and see its training metrics in the **Fine-Tune Info** tab.

#### API
Use the API to run evals using your new model

<Tabs groupId="run_inference">
  <TabItem value="python">
  
  ```python title="run_inference"

fine_tuned_metric = Metric(name="My Custom Evaluation Metric") # Reference the fine-tuned model by name or id

# Run evals on your test/holdout dataset to see how the model is performing
test_results_df = client.evaluate_dataset(test_dataset_id, fine_tuned_metric)

# Run evals on any application data
eval_results_df = client.evaluate_data(
    # data should include the columns that the model expects
    data=pd.DataFrame({
        "input": ["What is the meaning of life?"],
        "output": ["42"],
        "ground_truth": ["Life, universe and everything"]
    }),
    metrics=[fine_tuned_metric],
)
```

  </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="node.js">
  
  ```typescript title="run_inference"
import { AutoEval, Metric } from "lastmile/lib/auto_eval";
const client = new AutoEval({
    apiKey: "api_token_if_LASTMILE_API_TOKEN_not_set",
});

const metric: Metric = {
    name: "My Custom Evaluation Metric",
};

console.log(`Waiting for fine-tuned model '${metric.name}' to be available as a metric...`);
const fineTunedMetric = await client.waitForMetricOnline(metric);
console.log(`Fine-tuned model '${metric.name}' is now available as a metric with ID: ${fineTunedMetric.id}.`);

// Run evals on your test/holdout dataset to see how the model is performing
const testResults = await client.evaluateDataset(testDatasetId, fineTunedMetric);
console.table(testResults);

// Run evals on any application data
const results = await client.evaluateData(
    /*data*/ [
      {
        "input": "What is the meaning of life?",
        "output": "42",
        "ground_truth": "Life, universe and everything"
      }
    ],
    /*metrics*/ [fineTunedMetric]
);
console.table(results);
```

### Weights & Biases integration

AutoEval allows you to track detailed training runs in your own Weights & Biases account. To do so, navigate to the [API Keys console](https://lastmileai.dev/apikeys), and save your W&B API key.
Subsequent fine-tuning runs will be tracked in your account.
