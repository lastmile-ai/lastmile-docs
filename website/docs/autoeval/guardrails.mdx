# Guardrails

Evaluation and guardrails are 2 sides of the same coin

Guardrails are just evaluators that run online. If you could detect a hallucination fast enough, why not catch that in the application's runtime
and prevent the issue from surfacing to the user?

Because [AutoEval models](/autoeval/models) are fast (< 300ms on CPU and < 10ms on GPU) and cheap to operate (1/1000th the size of GPT-4), you can run them
*on every response* as a guardrail without compromising on user experience.

**Coming soon**: Trust and safety features that allow you to provision guardrail endpoints and set appropriate thresholds for pass/fail.

### Usage Guide

Use the [API](/category/sdk) to compute metrics in the application runtime: 

<Tabs groupId="guardrail">
  <TabItem value="python">
  
  ```python
from lastmile.lib.auto_eval import AutoEval, Metric
import pandas as pd

def guard(input, output, context, metric: Metric, threshold=0.5) -> bool:
    client = AutoEval(api_token="api_token_if_LASTMILE_API_TOKEN_not_set")

    result = client.evaluate_data(
        data=pd.DataFrame({
            "input": [input],
            "output": [output],
            "ground_truth": [context]
        }),
        metrics=[metric]
    )

    score = result[f"{metric.name}_score"][0]
    return score >= threshold

# Define a faithfulness guardrail:
guard(
    input="Where did the author grow up?",
    output="France",
    context="England",
    metric=Metric(name="Faithfulness")
)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Fine-tune a custom guardrail
You can build your own input/output guardrail models using the [fine-tuning service](/autoeval/fine-tune).
For example, you can define a custom input guardrail that determines if the input is relevant to the purpose of the application,
and denies irrelevant requests.
