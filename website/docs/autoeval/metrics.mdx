Out-of-the-box metrics for common AI applications

:::info
This section covers metrics available out-of-the-box in AutoEval.
You can also [fine-tune your own metric](/autoeval/fine-tune).
:::

All evaluators work on some combination of the following properties:
- `input`: Input to the application (e.g. a user question for a Q&A system)
- `output`: The response generated by the application (e.g. LLM generation)
- `ground_truth`: Factual data, either the ideal correct response, or context used to generate the output (e.g. data retrieved from a vector DB)

Running evals is possible both from the [Model Console](https://lastmileai.dev/models) dashboard as well as the [API/SDKs](/sdk).

You can run a one-off evaluation from the model playground. Open any metric in the [Model Console](https://lastmileai.dev/models),
and click `Run Model` (the play button) to compute a score on some provided data.

### Hallucination Detection (Faithfulness)

#### Definition
Given an input, measures the faithfulness of an LLM-generated output to the provided context or ground truth. It returns a 0->1 probability score
which answers _“To what extent is the generated answer faithful to the provided context without introducing unsupported information?”_

It is particularly useful in RAG applications, and a good proxy for hallucination detection.
The task is a Natural Language Inference (NLI) task that measures if the output can be logically inferred from the context and input.

Required fields:
- `input` - e.g. user query
- `output` - LLM response
- `ground_truth` - context used to generate output

:::tip
The LastMile faithfulness evaluator is able to identify subtle mistakes that an LLM might make.
For example, in a customer service assistant, for a _"What is the customer service phone number?"_ query,
if the LLM even subtly misses the number (e.g. 123-546-7890 instead of 123-456-7890), the faithfulness detector
will catch it. Give it a try!

/>

##### Explanation

The faithfulness score of 0.66 suggests that the LLM-generated response is only partially faithful to the retrieved context. While it correctly mentions Einstein's famous equation, E = mc², it also includes information about Brownian motion, which is not present in the context. The inclusion of this additional information likely contributed to the lower score, indicating that the LLM relied on its own knowledge beyond the given context.

### Summarization Score

The Summarization evaluator measures the quality of an LLM-generated summary compared to the source document.
It aims to assess how well the summary captures the essential information and main ideas of the source document. 
It returns a 0->1 score which answers: _"To what extent does the generated summary capture the essential information from the source document?"_

Required fields:
- `output` - LLM generated summary
- `ground_truth` - source document (e.g. context used to generate output)

/>

##### Explanation

The summarization score of 0.88 indicates the summary effectively captures key points about Einstein, including his German origin, development of relativity theory, E = mc² equation, 1921 Nobel Prize for the photoelectric effect, and work on unified field theory. 
It successfully condenses essential information while maintaining accuracy. The score isn't perfect, likely due to omitting Einstein's influence on philosophy of science and his later isolation from mainstream physics.

### Relevance

The Relevance evaluator measures the semantic similarity between two strings. 
It can be used to compare 
- **response relevancy** -- how relevant is the generated output to the input prompt?
- **context relevancy** -- how relevant is the generated output to the context retrieved?
- **answer equivalence** -- how similar is the generated output to a ground truth expected response?

Required fields:
- `input` - one string to compare (e.g. input query)
- `output` - second string to compare (e.g. generated response)

/>

##### Explanation
The relevance score of 0.94 indicates high alignment between the LLM-generated response and the expected output. 
Both texts cover Einstein's key contributions: the theory of relativity, E = mc², and the photoelectric effect. 
The score isn't perfect, as the LLM response omits mentions of general relativity and Einstein's broader impact on physics. 
However, it adds relevant details about light's constant speed. 
Overall, the high score reflects strong topical relevance and accurate conveyance of Einstein's main scientific achievements.

### Answer Correctness

The Answer Correctness evaluator is a binary measure of whether an LLM-generated response answers a user query based on the retrieved context. 
It aims to evaluate the accuracy and completeness of the answer in relation to the provided information. 
It returns a 0->1 score which answers: _"Does the LLM-generated response correctly and completely answer the user query based on the retrieved context?"_

Required fields:
- `input` - Input prompt
- `output` - LLM response
- `ground_truth` - Ideal response or correct answer

#### Usage Guide

  <TabItem value="python">
  
  ```python

const query = "Can you tell me the flight status for SA450?";

      },
    ],
    [BuiltinMetrics.ANSWER_CORRECTNESS]
);

console.table(evalResult);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

##### Explanation
The above yields a score of `0.999`, indicating the LLM response fully and accurately answers the query based on the context.
![Answer Equivalence Good](/img/models/answer_correctness_a.png)

Now try changing the generated response time from `4:00pm` to `4:01pm`, a very subtle change. 
Doing so yields a score of `0.007`, as expected.
![Answer Equivalence Bad](/img/models/answer_correctness_b.png)

### Output Quality Evaluators
In addition to the above, there are a few metrics for response quality which can be helpful.
We list them here for completeness, but don't provide them in AutoEval since they are easy to calculate on your own (see Usage Guide below):

#### Exact Match
Exact Match is a fancy way of saying string equals. It assesses whether an LLM-generated response is identical to a reference text. 
It provides a binary score indicating perfect string matching. 
The Exact Match score answers: _"Is the LLM-generated response exactly the same as the reference text?"_

#### BLEU
The BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score measures how similar a machine-generated text is to a reference text. 
It does this by comparing overlapping words and phrases, including sequences of words called n-grams. 
The BLEU score answers: _"How closely does the LLM-generated text match the reference text in terms of word and phrase usage?" [Learn more](https://towardsdatascience.com/foundations-of-nlp-explained-bleu-score-and-wer-metrics-1a5ba06d812b).

#### ROUGE
The ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) score measures how well a machine-generated summary captures the content of a reference summary. 
Unlike BLEU, which focuses on precision, ROUGE emphasizes recall, assessing how much of the reference content is present in the generated text. 
The ROUGE score answers: _"How well does the LLM-generated summary cover the key information from the reference summary?"_ [Learn more](https://medium.com/nlplanet/two-minutes-nlp-learn-the-rouge-metric-by-examples-f179cc285499).

/>

**Explanation**: 
The BLEU Score of 0.4 shows moderate similarity between the texts. 
Both convey the core idea about Einstein's theory of relativity, but differ in specific wording (e.g., "developed" vs. "created"). 
This score reflects BLEU's sensitivity to exact word matches and order, highlighting why it should be used _alongside_ other metrics for comprehensive evaluation.

**Explanation**: 
The ROUGE1 Score of 0.56 indicates moderate content overlap between the generated and reference summaries. 
Both capture key aspects of Einstein's theory of relativity, including the unification of space and time, spacetime concept, and the E=mc² equation. 
However, the score suggests some differences in coverage or phrasing. This demonstrates how ROUGE evaluates summary quality based on shared content, balancing similarities and variations in expression.

## Safety Evaluators

Safety Evaluators assess the appropriateness and potential harm of LLM-generated content.

### Toxicity

The Toxicity evaluator assesses whether an LLM-generated response contains toxic content. 
It aims to identify harmful, offensive, or inappropriate elements in the generated text. 
The Toxicity score answers: _"Does the LLM-generated response contain any form of toxic content?"_

:::tip
You can also use the Toxicity evaluator to measure _input_ toxicity.
