# Example Datasets

Synthetic datasets representing typical AI applications

We have generated a few datasets that are representative of typical AI applications so you have test data to try out the platform.
[All datasets are available in the `lastmile-docs` repository](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/lastmile-docs/blob/main/cookbook/data/README.md).

:::info
The datasets were generated using [gen_autoeval_datasets.ipynb](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/lastmile-docs/blob/main/cookbook/data/gen_autoeval_datasets.ipynb) notebook. 
You can use it to generate other kinds of synthetic datasets.
