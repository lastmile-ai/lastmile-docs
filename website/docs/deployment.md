# Deployment Options

## Hosted by LastMile AI

LastMile AI provides a hosted version of the AutoEval platform and the AlBERTa models. Users can try the platform as a service without installing the platform onto their environment. The hosted platform is a single-tenant service with usage based billing. For users looking for an on-prem installation, visit [Containers on Private Clouds](#private-clouds).

## Containers on Private Clouds {#private-clouds}

LastMile AI provides a deployable container (OCI) that can be hosted on your private cloud through [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Podman](https://podman.io/), or any other OCI certified service. If you are interested in hosting the AutoEval and AlBERTa models within your private cloud, please contact [sales@lastmileai.dev](mailto:sales@lastmileai.dev).
