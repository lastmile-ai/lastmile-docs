    ## Features and Capabilities

    - **alBERTa evaluator models**: 400M parameter NLI entailment models that are optimized for evaluation tasks like faithfulness, relevance and other key metrics.
    - **LLM Judge labeling service**: Label your LLM application traces using LLM Judge evaluation criteria, and refine the labels with human-in-the-loop active labeling.
    - **Fine-tuning service**: Design your own evaluation metric using the fine-tuning service. This is the first-of-its-kind service which you can use to develop as many evaluators as you need to measure AI application performance across a fully customized criteria.
