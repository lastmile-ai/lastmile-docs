# Deployment Options

Hosting options for the AutoEval platform

The AutoEval platform is available as a single-tenant hosted service from https://lastmileai.dev. It is free to get started, [run evals](/autoeval/models), generate labels with [LLM Judge](/autoeval/labeling), [fine-tune](/autoeval/fine-tune) custom metrics and create [guardrails](/autoeval/guardrails).

For customers needing more control over the platform data plane or control plane, often for added security and privacy guarantees, we offer VPC deployments on any cloud provider.

:::info
AutoEval is already in use at several Fortune 500 enterprises, and can be deployed within enterprise VPCs on AWS, Azure, GCP, and even on-prem.

### Service Architecture
LastMile AI provides deployable containers (OCI) that can be hosted on your private cloud through [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Podman](https://podman.io/), or any other OCI certified service. 

Here is the AWS service architecture for the AutoEval platform. Similar deployments are available for Azure and Google Cloud.

#### Hybrid Deployments
In certain cases, you may want to have more fine-grained deployments (e.g. use the hosted platform for fine-tuning, but deploy the models and inference server in VPC).
This hybrid deployment is also available, and depends on which part of the control or data plane you need control over.
